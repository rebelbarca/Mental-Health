                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning (ML) can be viewed as an artificial intelligence (AI) that is not specifically programmed to but utilises algorithms to use historical data allowing software applications to predict accurate new output values which can be used in decision making for enterprises for future endeavours. ML can provide trends in customer behaviour and business operations that can lead to new developments in products. There are four basic approaches to ML where the algorithm takes in data and adapts it to learn how it can develop more accurate predictions. Data scientists choose which approach to take depending on the information that needs to be predicted. The approaches include:</p>
                <p>Supervised Learning:  The data scientist supply training data and defined variables to the algorithm for it to access for correlation. The algorithm is trained to deal with labelled inputs and desired inputs (Burns, E., 2022. www.techtarget.com). One can use this approach for the following tasks:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Binary classification: Dividing data into two categories.</li>
                    <li>Multi-class classification: Choosing between more than two types of answers.</li>
                    <li>Regression modelling: Predicting continuous values.</li>
                    <li>Assembling: Using predictions from multiple ML models to produce an accurate outcome.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>(Burns, E., 2022. <a href ="www.techtarget.com" target="_blank">www.techtarget.com</a>)</p>
                <p>Unsupervised learning:  The algorithm scans through a data-set searching for relevant connections. The data that the algorithm trains on and the recommendations it outputs are predetermined. This ML does not require data to be defined. When sifting through an unlabelled data-set, patterns are recognised and used to group data points into subsets. Deep learning and neural networks use this type of ML along with the following tasks:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Clustering: Spilt datasets into similarity groups.</li>
                    <li>Anomaly detection: Identify unusual data points.</li>
                    <li>Association mining: Identify sets of items within a dataset that continuously occur together.</li>
                    <li>Dimensionality reduction: Reduce the number of variables in a dataset.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Burns, E., 2022. <a href ="www.techtarget.com" target="_blank">www.techtarget.com</a>)</p>
                <p>Semi-supervised learning: The algorithm does get labelled data from user input, but the model is free to explore and develop its own understanding of the dataset. The ML defines the dimensions of the dataset, which it then applies new unlabelled data. Using labelled data can take a lot of time and expensive. This approach combines the performance of supervised learning with the efficiency of unsupervised learning (Burns, E., 2022. www.techtarget.com). Some areas include:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Machine translation: Teach algorithms to utilise a dictionary of words to translate languages.</li>
                    <li>Fraud detection:  Using a couple of positive examples to identify cases of fraud.</li>
                    <li>Labelling data: Applying data labels from small from datasets to larger datasets automatically.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Reinforcement learning: Defining rules to teach a machine to complete multi-step processes. The user provides positive and negative outcomes to which the machine determines its own steps it wishes to take along the way in completing the set task. The machine is programmed to seek positive rewards in order to perform tasks that is beneficial to the ultimate goal. It is also programmed to avoid punishment that it will receive if tasks are perform that will push it further away from the ultimate goal. This type of learning is used in areas such as:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Robotics: Robots use this approach to perform tasks in the physical world.</li>
                    <li>Video gameplay: Being able to teach robots to play certain video games.</li>
                    <li>Resource Management: Enterprises are able to make decisions by providing the algorithm with finite resources and a defined goal through which it can predict patterns and provide outcomes that can be used to determine how to allocate its resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The recommendation engine that is used by Facebook to power its news feed is a well-known example of how ML is used in today’s society. When a member reads particular group posts, the engine will begin to show more of the activities of that group earlier in the feed. By reinforcing patterns of online behaviours of users, the engine is able to adapt and adjust to the user if they change patterns by reading other posts. This enables ML to personalise how a user’s feed is delivered. Other uses for ML include:</p>
                <p>Customer relationship management (CRM): CRM software covers everything from marketing and sales to commerce and customer service. An example would be the ML models being able to analyse emails and prioritise them for the sales team to respond to the most important ones.</p>
                <p>A CRM system lets you:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>store customer and prospect contact information.</li>
                    <li>identify sales opportunities.</li>
                    <li>record customer service issues.</li>
                    <li>manage marketing campaigns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CRM is a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with existing and potential customers. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to their customers, streamline processes, and increase business profitability all in one central location, and makes information about every customer interaction available to anyone in your company who might need it.</p>
                <p>A CRM system can help companies of all sizes drive business growth, where teams often need to find ways to do more with less. From sales, customer service, business development, recruiting, marketing or any other line of business, CRM provides a better way to manage the external interactions and relationships that drive business success.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most significant recent development in CRM systems has been the move from on-premises CRM software into the cloud. Cloud-based CRM systems such as Salesforce mean that every user has the same, up-to-date information, all the time. Your sales teams out on the road can check data and update it instantly after a meeting and work from anywhere. A cloud-based CRM provides faster deployment, automatic software updates and increased collaboration.</p>
                <p>Business intelligence: Identify important data-points, patterns of data-points and anomalies that can be analysed for business decisions.</p>
                <p>Human resource information systems: Algorithms are used to sort through applications and identify the best candidates for a particular job.</p>
                <p>Self-Driving Cars: ML can be implemented into semi-autonomous car to identify visible objects on the road and alert the driver.</p>
                <p>Virtual Assistants: Interpret natural speech and convert it into data and supply context.</p>
                <p>Machine learning has been utilised ranging from predicting behaviour patterns to building an operating system for self-driving cars. Algorithms are able to learn associations and assist in product development and marketing strategies according to customer demand by collecting user data and correlating it with behaviour patterns. This allows enterprises to understand their clients/ customers at a deeper level. Companies such as Uber and Google use machine learning as their driving force behind their business models. Uber “uses algorithms to match drivers with riders. Google uses ML to surface the ride advertisements in searches” (Burns, E., 2022. www.techtarget.com).</p>
                <p>Data scientists who command high salaries are responsible for the creation of machine learning projects which require software infrastructure, this can become expensive when implementing ML models. If algorithms are supplied data that excludes specific populations or contains coding errors, it can lead to inaccurate and bias models of the target goals of the enterprise which can run into regulatory and reputational damage.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">(Burns, E., 2022. <a href ="www.techtarget.com" target="_blank">www.techtarget.com</a>)</p>
                </div>

                <p>Machine learning models can be complex and are able to predict accurate outcomes but trying to explain how these models work and how certain outputs were determined can be difficult. Data scientists have to revert using simple models so that enterprises are able to explain how every decision was made. This applies to industries with heavy compliance burdens such as banking and insurance.</p>
                <p>This technology has been around for decades, most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications are powered by deep learning models. Major vendors such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are pushing for their users to sign up for ML platforms where they cover a range of activities such as:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Data collection</li>
                    <li>Data preperation</li>
                    <li>Data classification</li>
                    <li>Model Building</li>
                    <li>Training</li>
                    <li>Application deployment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Burns, E., 2022. <a href ="www.techtarget.com" target="_blank">www.techtarget.com</a>)</p>
                <p>The ML platform wars will intensify as it continues to become an integral part of business operations and as AI becomes more practical in the enterprise environment. In order to produce an algorithm that can perform a task at an optimal level requires extensive training. Programming a machine that is able to apply context learned from one task to future, different tasks require research and techniques into deep learning and AI that will create flexible models and will lead to increasing focus in developing general applications.</p>
