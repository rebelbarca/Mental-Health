    "I am a self/ goal-driven person who can work independently and as part of a team. I live in Sydney with my wife and kids and have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My interest in IT began when I started pulling apart computers and putting them back together again. I am a highly motivated and hardworking individual. My education in full stack web development at the University of Sydney, and self-taught knowledge and experience combined with my interest, passion and enjoyment in coding, programming, Cloud Computing and Virtualization, will enable me to learn, contribute and excel in the Web Development Industry.",
    "paragraph01":
    "My ability to learn new coding languages and programs enables me to understand coding concepts quickly which can then be transferred and utilized in developing user-friendly web-based applications using html, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap, jQuery and many more coding languages and concepts. My degree in Mechanical Engineering showed me that it is important that function and making sure that what you build or create works in the way you intend before you worry about how it will look. I enjoy working out how things work and why they function the way they do. I enjoy the programming and back-end side of things. I prefer being the person behind the scenes. I like challenging myself to prove to myself that I can accomplish anything that is thrown at me.",

My best memories as a child are of the times my uncle would bring over new PC parts to upgrade our family computer, and all the new games he used to spoil me with. From there my interest sparked and I became the family tech guy; every time there was an IT related issue it was my duty to fault find and fix. My lack of formal education has impeded my ability to join the tech industry until know when my sales background has allowed me to gain employment at Microsoft.",

    "My interest in IT started when I started playing the Xbox Classic. My personal interest with IT is the way that we can fundamentally manipulate everyday appliances/software to do anything that you can think of. My interest was sparked by my father and his brother. My experience is IT is a basic understanding of the fundamentals but have delved into some more advanced things in the recent past. I chose to go to RMIT as it was one of the best universities for IT/Programming. Recommended to me by my uncle as he was offered a place here when he went to university. I expect to further my knowledge of IT and programming during my studies as I see myself starting my own company once I have completed my studies.",
